# Task 
# The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
    
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)

# Add logic to print two lines. 
# The first line should contain the result of integer division,  a//b . 
# 4 // 3 > 1
# The second line should contain the result of float division,  a/b .
# 4 / 3  > 1.33333333333

print(a//b)
print(a/b)
